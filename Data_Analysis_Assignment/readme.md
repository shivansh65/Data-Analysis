# Data Analysis Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains my project on data analysis using the Chicago Traffic Crashes dataset. However, due to GitHub's file size limitations, I was unable to include the large dataset directly in this repository. Instead, you will need to download the dataset separately.

## How to Get Started

1. **Download the Dataset:**
   - Download the Chicago Traffic Crashes dataset from the following link:
     [Chicago Traffic Crashes Dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-2018-to-Present-Updated-2025-03-06-1-zip-file)
   - Please save the dataset file on your local machine.

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Data-Analysis.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd Data-Analysis
     ```
   - Open the Jupyter notebook `main.ipynb`:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook main.ipynb
     ```
   - This notebook will clean the dataset and save the cleaned data as a new file.

## Dataset Details

The dataset contains information about traffic crashes that occurred in Chicago. The notebook processes the dataset, cleans it, and saves a cleaned version for further analysis.
